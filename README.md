In Google Colab, we implemented and explored fundamental concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through Python code using NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV. Here's a simplified description of what we did:
  
   Convolution Operations:
        We performed convolution on a small matrix using a kernel, varying the stride and padding parameters. This helped us understand how these parameters affect the output feature map.

   Edge Detection with Sobel Filters:
        We used OpenCV to load an image and apply Sobel filters to detect edges in the horizontal and vertical directions. This demonstrated how convolution can be used for image processing tasks.

  Pooling Operations:
        We created a random matrix and applied Max Pooling and Average Pooling operations using TensorFlow/Keras. This showed how pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of a feature map.

   CNN Architectures:
        We built a simplified AlexNet model, defining its layers and printing its summary. This allowed us to understand the structure of a classic CNN architecture.
        We built a simple ResNet model, creating a residual block and using it to build the network. This showed how residual connections can improve network performance.

Essentially, we worked through basic CNN operations, image processing using convolutions, and building simple CNN models, all within the Google Colab environment.
